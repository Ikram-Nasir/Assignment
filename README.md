The main objective of assignment is to define different arithmetic functions for complex numbers and use them through linklist. This file contains the names and basic purpose of all the attached files. Output of program is also given at the end.

Total Files:
	    There are total 5 files in the project. These are as follows:
  
1.	main.cpp 
      In this file , the int main() is defined and called. All the linked files have been included and required functions are also being called.

2.	linklist.h
      The prototypes of all variables and member functions of  linklist class are included in this file.

3.	linklist.cpp
      The functions’ definitions  for the class linklist are being defined in this file.

4.	complex.h
      The prototypes of all variables and member functions of  complex class are included in this file.

5.	complex.cpp
      The functions’ definitions  of  the class linklist are being defined in this file.
